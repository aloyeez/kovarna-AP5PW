    "mainTitle": "Something about our Pub‚Ä¶",
    "history": "Hosp≈Ødka U Kov√°rny was founded as a family business in 1993, and the name was suggested by local residents and neighbors who still remembered when there was a blacksmith shop opposite our pub, which was set up by blacksmith Franti≈°ek Bart√≠k along with an apartment from a former barn. This blacksmith shop was still in operation after World War II.",
    "capacity": "In our restaurant, which we try to run in a family spirit, there are about 60 seats, and in the summer months, two summer gardens with an additional 50 seats are prepared for our guests.",
    "events": "It will be our honor and pleasure to offer you the organization of events for larger groups, such as weddings, corporate parties, anniversary celebrations, graduations, etc. - don't hesitate and write to us for more non-binding information.",
    "smoking": "Since we became a voluntarily non-smoking restaurant on May 1, 2008, we have focused even more on our menu with traditional Czech dishes and modern food preparation trends, guaranteeing the freshness of all ingredients used. Lunch menu offers are also a matter of course.",
    "beer": "Furthermore, we would like to offer you excellent beer from ƒåern√° Hora brewery and also Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, which you can have poured at our place in one go, so-called \"na hladinku\". This is a little-known style, especially in Moravia, but it is the best and most gentle way of pouring beer. The result is beer at an ideal temperature of 7¬∞C with beautiful foam similar to milk.",
    "welcome": "We will be happy to welcome you to our Pub and will try to ensure that you leave satisfied.",
    "visit": "We look forward to your visit.",
